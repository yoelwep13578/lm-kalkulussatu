# Latihan Mandiri Kalkulus 1 - Universitas Terbuka
_Independent Practice of Calculus 1 - Indonesia Open University_

## Causes and Motivation

I happen to be studying at Indonesia Open University (Universitas Terbuka), and I found that one of the independent practice (called "Latihan Mandiri") websites, lm.ut.ac.id, has been abandoned and is no longer maintained. This issue prevents future generations of students from benefiting from the Independent Practice materials.

During the exam period, a peer of ours shared an archive of the LM site in the form of HTML files like the one above. From there, I took the initiative (acting as the Tank/Initiator) to publish and host the archive in this repository.

## Purpose

The purposes of creating this repository are as follows:
- To archive part of the original site's content that was successfully captured.
- To provide an overview of Independent Practice materials for Calculus 1 at UPN.
- To serve as an alternative to lm.upn.ac.id, which had been abandoned and unmaintained, although this is specifically for Calculus 1 only.
